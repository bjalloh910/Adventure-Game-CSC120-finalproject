Our overall approach to this project was starting off my drawing a diagram of what we wanted the project to look like. How to add a delay for the fighting method is something new we learned. We wish we had implemented a way for the player to be allowed to move between each location however they wanted to instead of chronological order.If we had umlimited time we could had added pictures, more items, and more tasks such as maybe saying saving a princess. The most helpful feedback we received was adding a delay to the fight method so it would seem more like an actual fight, and we got it from a friend playing our game. The hints we would give is to break it down because it's more simpler that way. I worked with Angelica she was good at coming up with the storyline and I was good at implementing the code so we kind of bounce off of each other like that.
